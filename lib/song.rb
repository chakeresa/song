    "Hush little baby, don't say a word,\nPapa's gonna buy you a mockingbird.\n\nAnd if that mockingbird won't sing,\nPapa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.\n\nAnd if that diamond ring turns to brass,\nPapa's gonna buy you a looking glass.\n\nAnd if that looking glass gets broke,\nPapa's gonna buy you a billy goat.\n\nAnd if that billy goat won't pull,\nPapa's gonna buy you a cart and bull.\n\nAnd if that cart and bull turn over,\nPapa's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.\n\nAnd if that dog named Rover won't bark,\nPapa's gonna buy you a horse and cart.\n\nAnd if that horse and cart fall down,\nYou'll still be the sweetest little baby in town!"
